rap-styledtext
==============

Minimal RAP port of SWT's StyledText widget.

The port has many limitations, including:

- the widget is read-only, text can only be displayed but cannot be modified
- many public APIs have not been implemented
- no performance optimizations for large texts
- needs RAP 1.5.x (not 2.0.0)

I am making it available here, because I am using it in some of my own projects.
